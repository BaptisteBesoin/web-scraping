This is a personnal project in which I aimed at scraping data from an estate agency website using Python.

# Libraries used
- BeautifulSoup : used to scrape the data from the website
- Pandas : for data storage purposes

# Updates or changes to come
I would like to switch to _Selenium_ instead of BeautifulSoup to learn a new technology. Selenium is more popular and present in more languages than BeautifulSoup

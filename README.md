# About
This is a personnal project in which I wanted to try extracting data from a website and organizing them using different libraries in Python.

# Libraries used
- BeautifulSoup : provides different tools such as an HTML parser along with numerous ways to navigate the tree-like structure of an HTML file 
- Pandas : the _Dataframe_ provided by this library offer a "simple" yet very efficient and powerful data structure to store the extracted data
 
# Updates or changes to come
I would like to switch to _Selenium_ instead of _BeautifulSoup_ to learn a new technology. The main drawback of using BeautifulSoup is its incompatibility with dynamic loaded web pages.
For instance, if the content of a page is generated through a JavaScript program, BeautifulSoup will not be able to retrieve any valuable data. Therefore, using _Selenium_ would allow me
to extract data from more websites.
